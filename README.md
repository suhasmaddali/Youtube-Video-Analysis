There are different types of videos being uploaded everyday at different instants of time in Youtube. It would be really useful if the content of these videos is being analysed. It would be good to understand the different category of videos presently being uploaded in YouTube and look at different instances of time where they have been trending. In addition, it would help the users to understand the right time at which the videos could be uploaded and this ensures that a lot of time and effort is being saved during the uploading of different categories of videos. Moreover, these insights would help the company allocate time and resources during different parts of the year so that they get to know the videos that are being uploaded. Getting meaningful insights from the data and placing more emphasis on growing trends can alter the direction at which companies are operating and this would generate revenue and profits for them.

In this problem, we would be analyzing the various trends in YouTube which includes views, likes and dislikes. Understanding different trends that are found in YouTube could ensure that best results are being generated. We would be using different data visualization techniques to ensure that we get the best results and insights from the data.

In addition to this, new features would be created so that one could get a good view of the ways in which these features shape likes and views of different set of videos that are trending in youtube. Moreover, we would also look at different dates where the videos were trending just to get a good understanding of the overall distribution of data respectively. 

We would be working with California youtube data and perform data visualization to observe different trends present in the videos. We would be analyzing the videos and getting a good understanding of the data that is present at hand. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.
