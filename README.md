## Introduction 
There are different types of videos being uploaded everyday at different instants of time in __YouTube__. It would be really useful if the content of these videos is being analysed. It would be good to understand the different category of videos presently being uploaded in YouTube and look at different instances of time where they have been trending. In addition, it would help the users to understand the right time at which the videos could be uploaded and this ensures that a lot of time and effort is being saved during the uploading of different categories of videos. Moreover, these insights would help the company allocate time and resources during different parts of the year so that they get to know the videos that are being uploaded. Getting meaningful insights from the data and placing more emphasis on growing trends can alter the direction at which companies are operating and this would generate revenue and profits for them.

## Steps Considered
In this problem, we would be analyzing the various trends in YouTube which includes views, likes and dislikes. Understanding different trends that are found in YouTube could ensure that best results are being generated. We would be using different data visualization techniques to ensure that we get the best results and insights from the data.

In addition to this, new features would be created so that one could get a good view of the ways in which these features shape likes and views of different set of videos that are trending in youtube. Moreover, we would also look at different dates where the videos were trending just to get a good understanding of the overall distribution of data respectively. 

We would be working with California youtube data and perform data visualization to observe different trends present in the videos. We would be analyzing the videos and getting a good understanding of the data that is present at hand. 

## ðŸ‘‰ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
